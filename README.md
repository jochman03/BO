## Problem Descriptions

###  Lab 2 ‚Äì Graph Algorithms: Representation and BFS  
Implemented graph representations (adjacency matrix and adjacency list) and performed Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore reachable nodes from a given starting point. Used Python data structures and visualized traversal steps.

###  Lab 3 ‚Äì Minimum Spanning Tree: Dijkstra-Prims Algorithm (DPA)  
Constructed a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using a variation of Prim's algorithm often referred to as Dijkstra-Prims Algorithm (DPA). Implemented on weighted undirected graphs and compared tree costs. Focused on maintaining a priority queue and updating the MST incrementally.

### Lab 4 ‚Äì A* Search Algorithm
Implemented the A* pathfinding algorithm on graph structures. Used heuristic functions to guide the search and optimized traversal from source to target. Compared path costs and explored impact of heuristic accuracy.

### Lab 6 ‚Äì Traveling Salesman Problem (G-TSP)
Implemented a greedy algorithm for the Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem (G-TSP). The algorithm sorts all edges by increasing weight and adds them one by one, ensuring that no cycles are formed during the construction of the tour.

### Lab 7 ‚Äì PERT Algorithm
Implemented the Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) for project scheduling. Modeled tasks as edges and events as vertices to compute earliest and latest start times, detect critical paths, and visualize project timelines.

### Lab 9 ‚Äì Job Scheduling Problem
Implemented Johnson‚Äôs algorithm for two-machine job scheduling to minimize the total completion time. Extended the approach using the CDS (Campbell, Dudek, and Smith) heuristic for flow shop scheduling with more than two machines.

### Lab 10 ‚Äì Dynamic Programming: Integer Linear Knapsack Problem
Implemented a dynamic programming algorithm for the integer (unbounded) knapsack problem. Solved a linear optimization task with integer decision variables to maximize total value under capacity constraints, allowing multiple instances of each item.

### Lab 11 ‚Äì Dynamic Programming: Optimal Lot Sizing Problem
Implemented a dynamic programming algorithm to solve the lot sizing problem, determining the optimal production batch sizes over a planning horizon. The goal was to minimize total costs including setup and holding costs, while meeting demand in each period.
