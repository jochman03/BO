- 🔢 Integer Programming (ILP, MILP)  
- 🌐 Network Flow Algorithms (max flow, min-cost flow)  
- 📅 Scheduling and Assignment Problems  
- 📈 Visualization of solutions and optimization processes  

## Technologies Used

- Python 3  
- PuLP (LP/MILP modeling)  
- NetworkX (graph algorithms)  
- Matplotlib (visualization)  
- NumPy

## Problem Descriptions

### 🧪 Lab 2 – Graph Algorithms: Representation and BFS  
Implemented graph representations (adjacency matrix and adjacency list) and performed Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore reachable nodes from a given starting point. Used Python data structures and visualized traversal steps.

### 🧪 Lab 3 – Minimum Spanning Tree: Dijkstra-Prims Algorithm (DPA)  
Constructed a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using a variation of Prim's algorithm often referred to as Dijkstra-Prims Algorithm (DPA). Implemented on weighted undirected graphs and compared tree costs. Focused on maintaining a priority queue and updating the MST incrementally.
